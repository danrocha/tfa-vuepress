As I walked through the streets of Singapore, I kept thinking of Sim City. I remember back then, Sim City 2000 was just out and I would spend hours building the perfect city, following all kinds of guides and tips that I could find around the web, until the city grew big and rich enough for my favorite buildings to be available: the Arcologies. They were fascinating to the teenager me: huge futuristic buildings, a city within a building, with complex structure and a whole landscaped world on its top under a glass dome.

Maybe it is the looming Marina Bay Sands, or the weird, durian-shaped Esplanade next to it, or going further inland, the residential buildings from Moshe Safdie or Liebeskind, or Heatherwick's building in the University campus. Also, any of the vegetation-flooded building from WOHA sprinkled throughout Singapore. They all give the city this futuristic feeling, as if we were walking in the world of Sim City with arcologies and perfect landscapes and smart urban arrangements.

## Singapore

The city estate of Singapore, located on the southern tip of Malaysia, is an peculiar country. It is an island (plus 62 other islets), located on the southernmost tip of the Malay Peninsula (you basically cross a bridge and are in Malaysia). It started as a British colonial outpost in the early 1800s, suffered turbulent years during World War II, and gained independence in the 1960s:

> In 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles founded colonial Singapore as a trading post of the British East India Company. After the company's collapse in 1858, the islands were ceded to the British Raj as a crown colony. During the Second World War, Singapore was occupied by Japan. It gained independence from the British Empire in 1963 by joining Malaysia along with other former British territories (Sabah and Sarawak), but separated two years later over ideological differences, becoming a sovereign state in 1965. After early years of turbulence and despite lacking natural resources and a hinterland, the nation developed rapidly as an Asian Tiger economy, based on external trade and its workforce.

Its rapid development within the last 60 years turned it from a developing country into a global hub full of superlatives:

> The city ranks highly in numerous international rankings, and has been recognised as the most "technology-ready" nation (WEF), top International-meetings city (UIA), city with "best investment potential" (BERI), world's smartest city, world's safest country, world's most competitive economy, recently over-taking United States and Hong Kong. third least-corrupt country, third-largest foreign exchange market, third-largest financial centre, third-largest oil refining and trading centre, fifth-most innovative country, and the second-busiest container port.

However, this development is laden with controversy, with accusatioons of exploration of low-income workforce and immigrant labor. It is a pattern from many countries where development at all costs are practiced. The well-off part of the population thrive, and what tourists see are shiny highrises and a well-kept urban environment. But we should always take it all with a pinch of salt.

When I visited it, I spent most of my time running from building to building on my list, all the while trying to understand this melting pot of cultures. In one week, I savoured delicious food, slept in two buildings from WOHA, and walked dozens of kilometres all over town visiting the most intersting buildings.

There is just too much to see, so take this list as a simple and small curated list of what I consider the coolest, most daring, most audacious architecture in town.

For the first ten years, if I would have to separate out my business, it was 30% "We need Christoph to make a nice drawing on this and that" and 70% of like, "Oh, no, something went aterribly wrong. We have another 12 hours, let's call that guy. He will make a somewhat unembarrassing solution that will save our solution by deadline. And I love this kind of tension."

Chuck Close said, "Inspiration is for amateurs. Us professionals, we just go to work in teh morning."

The one thing I really love about that quote is that it relieves you of a lot of pressure. It's not about waiting for hours for this moemnt where inspiration strikes. It's just about showing up and getting started, and then something amazing happens or it doesn't happen. All that matters is that you enable the chance for something to happen.

The one thing that's dangerous about focusing on craft and working very hard is that it can keep you from askin the really relevant questions. I'm trying to get good at something, but is that thing that i'm trying to get good at the real thing.

It's a good place to work, but not a good place to refill your creative tank. I find it hard to reinvent.

The big, big problem with routine is that everything starts to look the same. So I'm constnatly trying to reinvent how I approach image making, how I approach storytelling, because the audience changes all the time, I change all the time.

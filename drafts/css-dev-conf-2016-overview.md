For those who follow me on my [go blog](http://www.bengozen.com), you know that I am enjoy providing detailed recaps on events that I attend. And with CSSDevConf 2016 being everything that it came to be for me, there was no way I was going to let this one slip by.

As far as the approach I'll be taking with this event, in-depth thoughts and discussions on topics heard or inspired from the talk will be discussed in separate posts in order to do each one justice. So be on the lookout for those in the near future!

With that said and done, onto the overview!

## Prologue

I first learned about CSSDevConf last year when Chris Coyier and Dave Rupert were talking about the amazing time they had aboard The Queen Mary in Long Beach, California. And when I went to find out more about what I had missed, I had a pretty big case of FOMO as some of the biggest names in the industry were there! So as you might imagine, I made sure to follow [@CSSDevConf](https://twitter.com/CSSDevConf) and keep up on any news for 2016.

Fast forward to February 2016 and I am psyched to see this appear in my inbox.

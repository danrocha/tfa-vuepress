## Travel &amp; Architecture

**Traveling always involves architecture.** From sleek glass and steel skyscrapers in large cities to the fisherman’s hut on a paradise beach, architecture is eventually surrounding us almost everywhere we go.

As an architect, I am fascinated by how spaces make you feel, how a building changes a city, how architecture can influence people’s behavior and interactions with each other. If the world is a book, architecture is one of its main characters. And, as the saying goes, those who do not travel read only one page.

**Our understanding of the power designed spaces will only evolve when we experience, in person, what’s been done throughout the world, both old and new, in different places and cultures.**

## Me

My name is Daniel da Rocha, I am by no means an expert in architecture or travel. I did not study in ivy league schools or worked in big-name architecture offices. But my career involved a lot of traveling, and I lived, worked and studied in four different countries in three different continents. **This constant state of "foreignness" definitely defined who I am as an architect as well as a person.**

When I travel, architecture is almost always the central focus. Sometimes, architecture is the first reason behind the traveling. Food, people, culture, photography; all comes together in a close second.

As much as I love traditional, or small scale architecture, I am also a sucker for large, tall, modern projects. When I travel somewhere, those are the first I like to visit. I like to see how they were built, the details; or how they offer us an entirely different way to interact with its surroundings; or how they fit within the context of the city. I love the power of buildings such as the **CCTV Tower** in Beijing, or the [**Burj Khalifa**](../blog/quick-guide-visit-worlds-tallest-building-burj-khalifa-dubai.md) in Dubai, but I also marvel at the ingenuity of small _hutong_ courtyard houses or houses on stints in river communities.

## The Foreign Architect

I've always liked to share my **travel experiences**. Several years ago I started a blog in my mother language (Portuguese) for my most devoted audience (my family), where I would write about my **life abroad**. It was a success, and it always represented a good reason to document every step of my ways.

But I've always had the desire to **reach a wider audience**, like-minded folks who are also interested in all of these things. And during my many hours of research for my own trips, I realized there was an abundance of people writing about travel, another multitude writing about architecture, but few putting them **together** to create something useful and inspiring for people like me.

That is the goal of this site: **to join architecture and travel in one place and to transform it into something useful or inspiring for you.** I am not a professional traveler like many out there, I have a day job and counted vacation days every year, but I do try to travel a lot, and I intend to turn each trip into a story worth of your time.

So bear with me, and **subscribe to receive news and notifications.** I promise to keep your privacy at a maximum and the bugging at a minimum:

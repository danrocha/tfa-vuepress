This week was crazy busy at work. It started well with a good amount of tasks to be tackled in a reasonable amount of time. But it quickly escalated to urgency when we suddenly had a new presentation on Friday, another on Sunday, and yet another on Monday. It is a huge project (more than 600.000 sqm!) with a huge team and a lot of politics in the mix. Not easy. Now, Sunday, I am finally able to look back at the week and let you know what has been grabbing my attention in between some Rhino sessions. --

## Cool projects

Architecture Studio](https://theforeignarchitect.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/batch___DSC5322-1100x912.jpg) Xiezuo Hutong Capsule Hotel in Beijing / B.L.U.E. Architecture Studio\[/caption\] As I write the guide to **Beijing’s Architecture**, I always keep an eye for new buildings in the city. [This hostel ](https://www.archdaily.com/886515/xiezuo-hutong-capsule-hotel-in-beijing-blue-architecture-studio)(or “capsule hotel”, as they call it), from B.L.U.E. Architecture Studio, occupies two courtyard homes in Beijing’s old hutongs, and is a charm. Very simple and well executed, a mixture of clean Scandinavian design and rough Chinese brickwork. Very different from the dirty hostels from my backpacking time! ![](https://theforeignarchitect.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/zumtobel-lighting-sustainable-austria-promotions_dezeen_2364_col_6.jpg) I was very impressed by [ Faruk Pinjo’s photos](https://www.dezeen.com/2018/01/17/promotion-zumtobel-led-lighting-messe-dornbirn-exhibition-centre-marte-marte-architects/) of **Dornbirn’s Exhibition Center**. Having recently designed an exhibition center for a competition, I know how hard it is to make these spaces simple and functional, as well as beautiful and inspiring. [Studio Marte.Marte](http://www.marte-marte.com/) did just that, with their mix of black and red to a very dramatic effect. --

## Travelust

[Roads & Kingdoms](http://roadsandkingdoms.com) recently redesigned their website, adding a much desired [**City Guides**](http://roadsandkingdoms.com/travel-guides/) section. Starting with a few cities such as [Tokyo](http://roadsandkingdoms.com/travel-guide/tokyo/), [Barcelona](http://roadsandkingdoms.com/travel-guide/barcelona/), and [Beirut](http://roadsandkingdoms.com/travel-guide/beirut/), they will be one of my first destination whenever I start planning my next trips. Still on R&K, they recently published two new articles which made me hungry and wanting to book a ticket yesterday: [A History of Tokyo in 8 Dishes](http://roadsandkingdoms.com/2018/a-history-of-tokyo-in-8-dishes/) and [The Real Dubai](http://roadsandkingdoms.com/2018/the-real-dubai/). --

## Fashion?

![](https://theforeignarchitect.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/original.jpg) It would probably be quite an interesting project to participate in. Rem Koolhaas, Herzog & De Meuron, the Bouroullec brothers, and Konstantin Grcic, [designed pieces for Prada’s 2018 fall menswear collection](https://archpaper.com/2018/01/koolhaas-herzog-meuron-industrial-pradas/). Black nylon was the material and “industrial” was the keyword. I am not a fan of luxury brands such as Prada, but I love the result, especially Koolhaas’s bulletproof vest style bag, picture above. ![](https://theforeignarchitect.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/adidas-trainers-bvg-collaboration-eqt-support-93-berlin-fashion-_dezeen_hero1-852x479.jpg) The design details in Berlin’s vast subway system are an infinite source of amazement. From the [wonderful signage](http://endbahnhof.tumblr.com/) to the [mildly-infuriating window decals](https://withberlinlove.com/2016/01/13/berlin-u-bahn-windows-wonky-brandenburg-gate-graphics/), one would never imagined they would become a coveted fashion accessory. **Adidas** released new shoes featuring the same **camouflage pattern** used in the city’s train seats, with an sewed-in annual transit pass. It drew huge crowds which [queued for days to get a pair](https://www.thelocal.de/20180116/hundreds-of-berliners-line-up-for-shoe-with-annual-transit-ticket-sewn-into-it), but mostly because of its price: 180€ for a pair of shoes containing a 728€ train ticket. --

## I want

![](https://theforeignarchitect.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Brutalist-Welbeck-Street-WEBSITE-CHAIR-820x532.jpg) [This wallpaper collection](https://www.dezeen.com/2018/01/12/brutalist-architecture-concrete-wallpaper-murals-design/) (real wallpapers, for your wall, not your screen) left me drooling. **Concrete** all over it, looks great with those beautiful chairs and will look great in my apartment as well.

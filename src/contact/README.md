# Newsletter

I am a big fan of e-mail newsletters. For me, it feels like a more direct connection with the authors I am interested in.

The best newsletters are those that seem especially curated, containing not only links to the author's latest content but other selected content around the topic. Beyond RSS (which I use a lot as well), it is a nice way to keep track of all new interesting content out there.

<strong>The TFA Newsletter will provide you with the latest content of this site, as well as selected links about architecture and travel.</strong>

Subscribe and receive every 2 weeks my little update to you.
